● What is JSX?
    JSX stands for javascript XML
    - html like syntax for creating complicated react element object
    - jsx -> converted to react object with the help of babel -> then is converted to js
● Superpowers of JSX
    - run any peice of js with the help of {} 
    - readability
    - checks for injection or sanitizes the data before executing it or prevent cross site scripting 
● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
    type attribute tell the type of file used(how to treat the file in the src tag)
    other options:
    -> Javascript MIMEtype or default
    -> importmap -> a json map which tell which module is where, where to load the module from
    -> module -> script is in the form of js module and would use CORS
    -> speculationrule -> telling what to prerender and what to prefetch
    -> datablock -> any invalid value other than the above 4 would lead to this, this just would act as a data carrier the things inside wont be executed as javascript
● {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
    - {TitleComponent()} - This is like calling normal js function which would render the html exactly but React would not have full control over it.
    - <TitleComponent /> - correct way of using functional component React is responsible for its life cycle
    - <TitleComponent> </TitleComponent> - according to chatgpt this is incorrect way of creating functional component
